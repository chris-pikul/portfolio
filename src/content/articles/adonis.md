# Adonis

Cold ached tired young hands. The sharp, electric kind of cold that comes when
submerging half-frozen hands into warm water after braving frost for too long.
At least, that was the first feeling Adonis had before realization set in. This
was not a frigid sensation, this was overwhelming heat; a torridity that the
human mind is not capable of understanding. Flashes of autumn sunsets on Earth
drown the situation momentarily as colors of ember and amber dance across tear-filled
gray eyes. The projection room may have been synthetic, constructed to instill
some sort of special pride and patriotism, but it nevertheless left a stark
impression on a young Ganymedian.

"I've done it" creeps quietly from thin lips. A phrase meant for internal
narration, but being of such pride and consequence forces itself projected verbally.
Adrenaline courses through gravity-weak veins as determination pushes both
conviction and concentration through the tuffs of flame being birthed from the
very skin of their person. The autumn warm fire begins to evolve. Shifting in
hue to blues and whites as it feeds off the power projected in confidence from
it's master. Heat intensifying as panic returns with the licks of flame traveling
up arm, bering ever closer to the heart and soul of their creator. The phrase
changes and escapes again, reborn into a new emotion, "_what_ have I done?". Self
preservation kicks-in as the motor functions command the fire be flung from it's
surface. Flicking hands wildly to no avail, expands to flailing arms as if to
eject some clinging stowaway. The fire seems pleased with this burst of energy,
growing brighter and cackling with laughter as it consumes more of the precious
oxygen atmosphere.

Over 150 years have passed since humanity decided that natural evolution of their
species was going to be unacceptably slow. For the results they wanted, and were
unaware they _needed_, they would have to take things into their own hands. Mars
taught them that. Europa saw the dissolving of cultural norms like "countries",
and "family names". Titan brought back corporate structure and clandestine
aspirations. Manifest destiny birthed the Ganymede colonies, which in turn started
the "Expansion Wars". Enceladus was established to fulfill two primary missions.
First, to prevent further expansion outwards to the remaining Saturn moons. And
secondly to prove that research could provide tools great enough to deter further
escalations.

"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic", from the
classical writer Arthur C. Clarke would summarize the policy. The Eden Corporation
supplemented this idea with "...and magic is indistinguishable from Gods, to heathens
without either". Thus the funding and establishment of Eden Research Facility
532, Enceladus was born. Colloquially referred to as "Manhattan" by the scholars who
called it home, and life. Management found it an endearing title to days past, but
locals knew it to be a short form of the historical name "Manhattan Project".

On this smooth, desolate, sub-zero moon exists a monolithic port of entry. An out
of place feature on an otherwise featureless landscape. Partially mirrored surface
of angular architecture colored quite purposely to be as bland and colorless as
possible. Featuring four large round pads of high-strength salt-encrusted carbon-
concrete expanding from a central polyhedron hub by opaque covered walkways. The
center of this hub containing three massive shafts capable of carrying enormous
volume and weight downward through the thick, icy crust that makes up Enceladus'
surface. Delving ever deeper these shafts eventually break through the imposing
glacial shelf, giving way to a pitch-black void of fluid salt. An ocean of
terrifying solitude houses the true "Manhattan" that is ERF-532. Terminating into
another central hub, the shafts become the arteries that keep this neutral-buoyancy
facility connected to the surface and beyond. A featureless surface of Tantulum-Steel
curved panels protect the soft precious innards from the crushing corrosive power
that is the Cassini Ocean. A large entryway provides transportation hubs, and
amenities for recreation to those who call this home. Thirty-Five Down, as it is
known. Quite simply because it sits thirty-five kilometers below the surface.

In a windowless room, as all rooms are here, on the northern arm of ERF-532, there
exists an unlikely sight for not only this facility, but this moon. The normally
gainsboro-gray colored walls are alight with warm amber tones as three individuals
study in shock as one of them battles their own discovery. Adonis stands center,
a tall lanky figure compared to their Earth-born counterparts. Alabaster skin and
gray eyes featuring little to no hair outside of a covering of blonde vellus hairs.
Genderless in their neutral distillation of the perfect space-pioneering humans;
as far as the procreation and generic scientists envisioned before the deployment
of the Second Ganymedian Generation. The other two specimens are of younger design
in comparison, but feature many of the same features as most everyone else on this
moon do including Adonis. Like the color of the walls in Adonis' laboratory;
undistracting and uninspiring is the theme here on Enceladus. But in the current
circumstance, this room is both distracting, and inspiring.

Flames erupt further from Adonis' arms as their two assistants realize that
control of this experiment is quickly vanishing. "Perhaps we should conclude this
run Adonis?" one speaks up. These words fall on deaf hears and the other assistant
glances towards the emergency panel with careful consideration.

"I've got this. I created it, therefor I can control it". The words only exist as
internal narration this time. Apparently lacking the conviction and confidence of
earlier slips. Where the words fail, so does the fire. Seemingly starved of the
energy provided through pride and naive conquest as the faults surface in the
mind of Adonis. They look to notice the second assistants moves as they motion
towards the emergency panel, arm beginning to reach for the end of this success.

"No!" Adonis yells, "I have this quite under control." they announce as the
synthetic gray fibers of their over-skin begin to carbonize black from the flames.
The second assistant halts their advance, but makes no intentions of returning to
the first assistant's side.

"We've come to far to throw this away now. Juno! Ensure the spacial recording is
focused on my arms!" Adonis commands. The first assistant, Juno, takes a second to
absorb the command before turning their attention to a control pad in their left
hand. With a slight twitch in the iris of Juno, the five spherical drones also
occupying the room adjust slightly as they move centimeters at a time closer to
Adonis' arms.

This new invigoration, confidence restoring itself as it breaths life back into
the flames through osmosis. Feeling the power coming under control, Adonis dares
to flex. Focusing on their dreams of one day gaining the admiration of their
masters in management. To be, recognized, by those mentors. By the only people
that could be considered parents to what can be conceptually considered an orphan.
A ward of the company has succeeded where no other ward could. The ticket Eden
has been looking for, a new generation of science and humans. A tear falls as
overwhelming self-pride causes a violent eruption of blues, oranges, reds, and
whites fills the room in an instant. A burst of inferno expels from Adonis'
palms, sending a shockwave of heat into the room. The present research drones,
which had gathered closer to Adonis are unable to bear the pressure. They emulate
now, the cannonballs of ancient history's battles. Launched with incredible power,
becoming projectile weapons not seen in centuries. Three become imbedded in the
otherwise blank walls, now decorating the blank slates with shrapnel and minor
craters. The other two find purchase in an otherwise unsuspecting assistant. In
a flash too quick for human response, Juno's right leg succumbs to the 10 centimeter
diameter drone. Blood streaks over the name plate embedded in the second assistants
overskin. The name "Reitia" becoming obscured in an instant. Reitia looks to their
co-worker, a natural reflex of humans to observe the facial expressions of others
so they may base their own reactions on them. The look of crushing dread forms on
Reitia's face as they discover there are no emotions on Juno to read. The second
drone found a different mark, and has removed the ability for Juno to show emotion,
or anything else for that matter. The nearly headless body falls backwards from
the impact, landing abruptly on a char-coated black glass floor.

Realization comes to Adonis. Not realization of Juno, nor Reitia. But for their
self. Realization that control is gone. Panic gives way to terror. One-hundred
and five years. A century of study, research, determination to be more than the
test-tube sample they came into this universe as. To be more than a first-name,
and number. To be, a _valued member_ of Eden. To be respected amongst their peers
in this solar system, and the ones that come after it. Adonis feels the dreams
slipping away like the ash his overskin is becoming. Eventual creeping disaster.

Terror has consumed the remaining living beings in this room, thirty-five kilometers
deep, as the all-consuming void that is Cassini Ocean ensures those who forgot
about her presence are made very aware. With a nerve wrenching creek the peppered
walls of Lab 64 moan, but remain vigilant in their task.

Reitia comes to from the shock of both the explosion, and the sight of their now
fallen comrade. Thirty-eight years they spent together in service of Eden.
Thirty-eight years come to a close after a failed experiment by want-to-be
narcissistic research lead. Such is life at the outskirt bases no body knows
about; except those who need to know of course. A side-effect skill that tubers
gain (those artificially made), is that death does cloud their judgement for long.
After all, when you're one of millions made in the same facility on the same day,
bred for purpose, as disposable extensions of humanity, the hive mentality becomes
what you know most. The preservation is for yourself in hopes you become more
than an instrument. "This has gone on far too long" Reitia thinks to them-self as
they continue on their previous task of ending this experiment early.

"No! You cannot do that!" Adonis proclaims. "After all the sacrifice!". Adonis
feels it all slipping away. They know quite well what happens to "failed experiments".
Control must be reclaimed, immediately.

"I. Just. Need. To focus..."

Terror is now giving way to hysteria as the rush of emotions feeds the doubt and
hunger of fire further.

"Why won't you stop!?"

Reitia has reached the panel and has abruptly smashed in the emergency alarm featured
prominently on the wall nearest the door.

"I'm so sorry" Reitia replies softly with tears welling. Adonis considers the words
intended for them, but Juno most certainly did not. A deep bassy note fills the
air and chests of all near by, complimented by a high pitched intermittent chirp.
Reitia quickly exits the room, as protocol dictates, but also to try to leave the
new past where it still is.

"NO! REITIA!" Adonis screams. They know the protocol better than anyone else, what
comes next will be pleasant for none concerned. In quick order, the sound of
boots quickly moving on hard floors echoing down drab hallways creeps into Adonis'
ears. "There is still time" they reassure themselves. "It was just a false alarm"
they lie to them-self. But the flames persist, greedily enjoying their buffet of
emotion. The hysteria is boiling up. One-hundred and five years is about to come
to a swift end over this. Fists clench as tightly as can be, willpower tries to
extract every last ounce of effort, tears fall of cheeks and land with a sizzle
on burnt fiber and glass.

"Just. STOP!" Adonis commands to them-self and their new consumer. The fire
cackles back. Gritting their teeth to the point where mineral-lacking enamel cracks
and begins to shatter, they make their final effort. Driving all the fear, hate,
panic, pride, conviction, soul into the final thought and words.

"Please, please! Just go away" Adonis says with desperate defeat. And with that,
the flames start to fade. The heat of fire dims, as the piercing ache of flame
touched nerves begin to scream even louder. Adonis is shocked by the sudden jolt,
bellowing out a scream of torture. The fire is leaving their hands, but so are
their hands altogether. Fingertips have dissolved into nothingness. Like sand
collapsing under it's own weight, shifting and sliding out of it's stoic shape.
The dissolving appendages seem to be chasing the fire-line as it races up the
hands. Not ash, not smoke, into nothing. As if their very reality was commanded
to leave. The screams continue, but the crawling line of destruction does as well.

The boots arrive at the partially open door of Laboratory 64. Six officers clad
in charcoal grey overskins bering emblems of Eden corporation security have
arrived. Reitia has removed them-self from the immediate area, but stands nearby.
Partially out of curiosity, but mostly out of protocol and duty. One of the
officers glances down at their wrist-display.

"Observation says exothermic explosion. Target is considered dangerous." they
announce to the rest of the team with authority. A pause stays the air with
silence enveloping it. A couple seconds later, the same officer gives the word.

"Order to terminate confirmed... Action.". The door is opened swiftly.

Adonis stands mortified and in excruciating pain as they are slowly being
consumed by nothingness, before their screams are silenced. The pain is over, and
the costs have been paid. The officers have efficiently ceased the experiment.

Three weeks later a meeting at Eden headquarters on Titan has project reports
being shared amongst ranking research managers. The eight individuals sit in
silence as they pour over the documents through mental consumption using their
personally affixed wrist-pads.

"The Adonis Effect is exactly what we've been looking for." one starts with.

"With proper stimulation and modifications to the neural pathways, we can impart
to our chosen assets the ability to modify reality as it seems." they continue.

"Magic. Actual magic. May be the next step of Eden. It may be the final step."

All heads nod in agreement. The cost was worth it. When technology has conquered
every other conceivable hurdle in reality, the next reasonable barrier to overcome
is reality itself. Manifest destiny, paves way to Masters of Reality. In the wrong
hands, it would quickly become cataclysmic. Good thing corporations have never
accidentally released anything dangerous before.
